title: Adopting a design mindset
---

Design work requires a mindset which can seem counterintuitive: every good designer that I know loves finding out when they are wrong.

In the course of daily life, being wrong has a cost. If you neglect to buy groceries on the weekend, you'll have to find a less convenient time to go. If you forget to call a loved one on their birthday, they may interpret this as lack of care. If you file your taxes incorrectly, you may face a fee.

Design mistakes have costs too, of course. If you design something that is confusing to use, guess what happens. Fewer people will successfully use it. So why do designers like discovering their mistakes? Because it's the designer's job to find those mistakes when the cost is lower, so the higher cost of shipping a mistake can be mitigated.

This is how I will be characterizing design throughout this book: as a means of figuring out how something should work *before* going through all the work of actually making it.
